# LANDSLIDE DETECTION SYSTEM
India, having the highest mountain chain, has 12 percent of the landmass prone to landslides. The landslides, being a major threat, call for timely detection. For our project, we propose the development of a Landslide Detection System in the areas that are affected massively by this natural calamity. The project aims to detect the forthcoming with the utmost accuracy to ensure that the necessary actions are taken to protect the losses of life and property.

## WORKING:
The detectors would be installed at suitable distances which would capture images via real- time monitoring. The movement along with the size and frequency of the captured object would be considered, to conclude if the moving mass is a landmass and if it signals a threat. If a threat is detected, a sound alert would be generated to alert the safety forces and the population.
Each unit would be independent and battery operated, which in turn would be powered by the solar power panel to continuously charge them.
